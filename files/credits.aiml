                They are important because if you don't earn enough of them, you may not be allowed to continue studying.

            <template>
                You must successfully complete the courses worth 20 credits for the past semester or 45 credits for the two past semesters in order to continue studying, so keep the number of credits in reserve.

                Each course in the whole MU has a certain number of credits, which you get for passing it.
                <break/>
                If the course is worth 5 credits, it means that a student is expected to spend 5 hours per week on the course.

                I personally recommend enrolling courses worth 35 credits, so that you can enroll fewer courses in your last semester.
